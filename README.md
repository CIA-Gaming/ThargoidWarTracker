# ThargoidWarTracker
A plugin for Elite Dangerous Market Connector that tracks activity in the thargoid war.

# Warning Thargoid samples are in alpha status.
We are currently testing with the plugin how to best track Thargoid samples.

# In order not to falsify the statistics:
- Please do not collect samples with taxis.
- Please only leave them in your cargo.
- Please sell directly in the Gameloop (Station or Carrier).
- Place a buy order on your carrier and sell it to your own carrier.
We are working on a solution.

## How to get started?
1. If you didn't do so already, head to the Releases and get the latest version of the plugin

2. Unzip the ZIP into the EDMC plugin folder

3. If EDMC was running, you need to restart it for the plugin to show up

4. Now head to https://twt.cia-gaming.de and use the "Sign in with Frontier" button in the header to login with your Frontier Account

5. If you logged in successfully you will be redirected to your profile page where you find your API key and Browser Source URL

6. Copy said API key into the appropiate field in the plugin settings in EDMC

That's it you're all set. Happy hunting Commander
